# Getting started guide

Welcome to rx! rx makes it easy to set up, use, and share a remote environment
while letting you continue to use all of your favorite local tools.

The getting started guide provides interactive examples to get you familiar with
rx. To begin, create a directory to use for this tutorial:

    $ mkdir getting-started
    $ cd getting-started

Install rx by running:

    $ pip install run-rx

See the [install docs](/docs/install) for more info.

`rx` can be used with any programming language, but this guide is available for
a few common ones. Feel free to use whichever language you're most comfortable
with to get started:

* [Node](node)
* [Python](python)
